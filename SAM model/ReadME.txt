The SAM model can be loaded with 3 different encoders: 
ViT-B, ViT-L, and ViT-H. 
ViT-H improves substantially over ViT-B but has only marginal gains over ViT-L. 
These encoders have different parameter counts, with ViT-B having 91M, ViT-L having 308M, 
and ViT-H having 636M parameters.

added model to .gitignore because it's size is 1.16 GB, which is out of limit for github
